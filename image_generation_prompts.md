## Scene 1: Living Room (`living_room.png`)

### Normal Version
**Filename**: `living_room.png`  
**Scene Data**: [living_room.json](file:///c:/Users/k_see/Documents/AntiGravity/HorrorGame/data/scenes/living_room.json)

**Prompt**:
```
A dark, atmospheric traditional Japanese living room at night. In the center, an old CRT television sits on a low wooden stand, its screen showing static (center, 35-65% horizontal). On the left wall (10-20% horizontal), a faded family portrait hangs with faces mysteriously scratched out. On the right side (80-95% horizontal), a large window with wooden frames shows pitch-black darkness outside, no stars visible, with rain streaking down the glass. In the lower right quadrant (55-65% horizontal, 70-78% vertical), a worn fabric sofa with cushions. The room has tatami mat flooring. A single dim overhead bulb casts long, nervous shadows. The walls are stained wood with water damage. Muted browns, dark greys, and sickly yellows. Cinematic horror lighting. No people. Wide shot. Premium horror aesthetics. Oppressive, uneasy atmosphere.
```

### Low-Sanity Version
**Filename**: `living_room_distorted.png`

**Prompt**:
```
The same living room, but reality is breaking down. The TV static shows screaming faces. The family portrait's scratched-out faces are watching you, bleeding through the frames. The window shows impossible geometries instead of darkness—writhing, non-Euclidean shapes. The walls appear to breathe and pulse. Shadows move independently of light sources. Colors shift to deep purples, sickly greens, and crimson reds. The sofa fabric looks wet and organic. Maintain the same furniture layout but make everything feel alive, wrong, and nightmarish.
```

## Scene 0: Inside Car (`inside_car.png`)

### Normal Version
**Filename**: `inside_car.png`  
**Scene Data**: `data/scenes/inside_car.json`

**Prompt**:
```
Interior of an old car at night, seen from the driver's seat. Rain streaks down the windshield and side windows, the glass reflecting a dim porch light and the silhouette of a traditional Japanese house ahead. The dashboard clock is visible near center (45-55% horizontal, 20-30% vertical) reading 3:12 AM. A rearview mirror hangs upper-right (65-75% horizontal, 18-32% vertical) with a faint, uneasy reflection. A closed glovebox sits lower-left (25-40% horizontal, 55-70% vertical), a crumpled note partially visible. The scene is dim, lit by dashboard glow and distant house light. Color palette: deep blacks, muted blues, cold greys, with a sickly yellow dashboard glow. Cinematic, oppressive atmosphere. No people. Wide shot from inside the car.
```

### Low-Sanity Version
**Filename**: `inside_car_distorted.png`

**Prompt**:
```
The same car interior, but reality feels wrong. Rain appears to run upward in places. The rearview reflection shows a shadow behind you. The dashboard clock flickers between times. The house silhouette outside the windshield is warped and too close. Colors shift to deep purples, sickly greens, and dark reds. Maintain the same layout but make the cabin feel claustrophobic and haunted.
```

## Scene 2: Grandmother's Room (`grandmothers_room.png`)

### Normal Version
**Filename**: `grandmothers_room.png`  
**Scene Data**: [grandmothers_room.json](file:///c:/Users/k_see/Documents/AntiGravity/HorrorGame/data/scenes/grandmothers_room.json)

**Prompt**:
```
A traditional Japanese tatami room (washitsu) at night with oppressive atmosphere. On the right side (60-80% horizontal, 40-75% vertical), a butsudan (Buddhist family altar) with dark wooden doors partially open, revealing photographs and cold incense ash, with one photo frame turned backward. In the lower left area (25-40% horizontal, 70-85% vertical), a worn diary lies on the tatami floor. In the lower center (40-65% horizontal, 75-90% vertical), a neatly rolled futon with a visible impression in the tatami beneath it. Rough wooden walls, sliding shoji screens in the background. Single flickering candle or dim bulb providing minimal light. Deep shadows in corners. Color palette: dark browns, faded golds, dusty greys, and deep blacks. Premium cinematic horror aesthetic. No people. Wide shot capturing the entire room.
```

### Low-Sanity Version
**Filename**: `grandmothers_room_distorted.png`

**Prompt**:
```
The same tatami room, but sanity is slipping. The butsudan's incense is burning despite being previously cold—smoke forms disturbing shapes. The photographs inside have eyes that follow you. The diary's pages flutter despite no wind, with writing appearing in real-time. The futon's impression rises and falls as if breathing. Walls appear to weep or bleed. Colors shift to deep purples, sickly greens, and crimson. Shadows have depth and substance, moving wrongly. The floor seems to undulate. Maintain layout but make everything subtly alive and wrong.
```

## Scene 3: Study (`study.png`)

### Normal Version
**Filename**: `study.png`  
**Scene Data**: [study.json](file:///c:/Users/k_see/Documents/AntiGravity/HorrorGame/data/scenes/study.json)

**Prompt**:
```
A cluttered traditional Japanese study room at night, filled with occult dread. On the left wall (10-35% horizontal, 20-80% vertical), floor-to-ceiling bookshelves packed with academic texts, folklore books (titles like 'Innsmouth', 'Deep Ones'), and marine biology volumes. In the center-right (50-80% horizontal, 50-75% vertical), a heavy wooden desk with papers, a half-written letter, and a locked drawer visible underneath. On the desk surface (38-46% horizontal, 35-47% vertical), a strange book bound in something that isn't quite leather, slightly glowing or pulsing. A single candle or dim desk lamp provides eerie lighting. Wooden floor, dark wood-paneled walls. Shadows pool in corners. Color palette: deep browns, dusty greys, faded yellows, and black. Premium horror cinematography. No people. Wide shot.
```

### Low-Sanity Version
**Filename**: `study_distorted.png`

**Prompt**:
```
The same study, but knowledge has become dangerous. Books rearrange themselves on shelves. The folklore section has expanded impossibly. One book spine shows YOUR name. The letter on the desk is now complete, describing tonight's events in real-time. The strange book radiates wrongness—its pages flutter with non-Euclidean text. Shadows have weight and presence. The walls seem to bend inward. Colors shift to deep purples, sickly greens, and dark reds. An impossible geometry pervades the space. Maintain furniture layout but make reality feel thin and breaking.
```

## Scene 4: Utility Room (`utility_room.png`)

### Normal Version
**Filename**: `utility_room.png`  
**Scene Data**: [utility_room.json](file:///c:/Users/k_see/Documents/AntiGravity/HorrorGame/data/scenes/utility_room.json)

**Prompt**:
```
A cramped, industrial utility room in an old traditional Japanese house at night. In the center-left area (35-65% horizontal, 20-65% vertical), a rusted electrical breaker panel mounted on the wall, with a thin gap along its seam. In the lower left corner (10-30% horizontal, 70-85% vertical), a cracked metal toolbox sitting on the floor, slightly open with tools visible. Bare concrete or rough wooden floor. A single hanging industrial bulb provides harsh, flickering light. Water stains on walls. Exposed pipes. Rusty metal fixtures. Color palette: industrial greys, rust browns, dark blacks, and sickly yellows. Claustrophobic framing. Premium horror aesthetic. No people. Wide shot showing the cramped space.
```

### Low-Sanity Version
**Filename**: `utility_room_distorted.png`

**Prompt**:
```
The same utility room, but machines have malicious intent. The breaker panel throbs like a heartbeat, dripping something dark. Electrical sparks form shapes in the air. The toolbox contains impossible tools. Pipes pulse and breathe. Walls appear organic, veined. Water stains look like reaching hands. Colors shift to deep purples, rust reds, and sickly greens. The bulb flickers revealing alternate realities between blinks. Maintain layout but make technology feel alive and hostile.
```

## Scene 5: Storage Closet (`storage_closet.png`)

### Normal Version
**Filename**: `storage_closet.png`  
**Scene Data**: [storage_closet.json](file:///c:/Users/k_see/Documents/AntiGravity/HorrorGame/data/scenes/storage_closet.json)

**Prompt**:
```
A cramped, dusty Japanese storage closet (oshiire) at night, filled with unsettling objects. On the lower left (15-30% horizontal, 65-75% vertical), a small pouch of coarse salt hangs above the doorframe. In the lower right (55-75% horizontal, 60-75% vertical), a lacquered wooden box sits on a shelf, partially open to reveal a braided ritual talisman inside. Shelves filled with old boxes, forgotten objects, and creepy traditional Japanese dolls with cracked porcelain faces staring into the darkness. Rough wooden walls. Minimal lighting from a crack in the door or single dim bulb. Thick dust in the air. Color palette: dusty browns, faded reds, dark greys, and deep blacks. Claustrophobic composition. Premium horror aesthetic. No people. Wide shot capturing the cramped space.
```

### Low-Sanity Version
**Filename**: `storage_closet_distorted.png`

**Prompt**:
```
The same storage closet, but childhood fears manifest. The dolls' eyes follow you, heads slowly turning. The salt pouch swings despite no wind. The talisman in the box glows with eldritch light. Boxes seem to shift position when you're not looking. Shadows have depth and reach out. The air is thick with something more than dust. Colors shift to deep purples, sickly greens, and dark reds. Objects appear closer than they should be. Maintain layout but make everything subtly alive and watching.
```

## Scene 6: Outside Porch (`outside_porch.png`)

### Normal Version
**Filename**: `outside_porch.png`  
**Scene Data**: [outside_porch.json](file:///c:/Users/k_see/Documents/AntiGravity/HorrorGame/data/scenes/outside_porch.json)

**Prompt**:
```
A rainy Japanese engawa (exterior porch) at night overlooking a shadowed, overgrown garden. In the center-right (60-85% horizontal, 50-80% vertical), an old car parked just beyond the porch, soaked with heavy rain, its door handle glistening. In the upper right (80-95% horizontal, 20-65% vertical), an overgrown path leading into darkness and twisted vegetation, barely visible through the rain. On the left (10-25% horizontal, 70-90% vertical), the doorway back into the house showing warm but ominous light. Heavy rain falling, creating mist and obscuring visibility. Wooden porch boards slick with water. No stars in the pitch-black sky. Color palette: dark blues, blacks, wet greys, and sickly greens from vegetation. Cinematic wide shot. Premium horror aesthetic. No people. Oppressive, isolating atmosphere.
```

### Low-Sanity Version
**Filename**: `outside_porch_distorted.png`

**Prompt**:
```
The same porch, but the outside world is wrong. The rain falls upward in places. The car appears to breathe, its windows fogging from the inside. The path shows impossible depths, spiraling into non-Euclidean space where the garden should be. The house door seems to reach for you with shadow-arms. The sky shows writhing shapes between rain droplets—cosmic entities observing. Colors shift to deep purples, sickly greens, and eldritch blues. The rain itself seems alive. Maintain layout but make nature and geometry betray logic.
```

## Scene 7: Hidden Shrine (`hidden_shrine.png`)

### Normal Version
**Filename**: `hidden_shrine.png`  
**Scene Data**: [hidden_shrine.json](file:///c:/Users/k_see/Documents/AntiGravity/HorrorGame/data/scenes/hidden_shrine.json)

**Prompt**:
```
A forbidden coastal shrine room, ancient and wrong. In the center (35-65% horizontal, 40-70% vertical), a damp stone altar with disturbing oceanic carvings—wave patterns that seem to move, deep-sea creature motifs, and geometric symbols that hurt to look at. The altar is covered in salt stains and dried seaweed. Walls are rough stone, covered in crude markings and bloodied talismans (ofuda). The floor is wet despite being indoors, pooling with saltwater. In the background, wooden torii gates at impossible angles. The air feels heavy with ancient presence. Minimal lighting from candles that burn with wrong-colored flames (blue-green). Color palette: wet greys, ocean blues, dark greens, rust reds, and deep blacks. Deeply unsettling atmosphere. Premium cosmic horror aesthetic. No people. Wide shot emphasizing the wrongness of the space.
```

### Low-Sanity Version
**Filename**: `hidden_shrine_distorted.png`

**Prompt**:
```
The same shrine, but the veil is thin. The altar carvings writhe and pulse with eldritch life. The water on the floor reflects impossible depths—you can see something massive rising from below. The talismans bleed continuously. The torii gates phase between dimensions. The walls appear to be made of flesh in places. Shadows have tentacular appendages. The candle flames form shapes of deep-sea horrors. Colors shift to deep purples, eldritch greens, and cosmic blues with hints of colors that shouldn't exist. The space feels like it's underwater despite being dry. Geometry defies physics. Maintain layout but make the shrine a gateway to something ancient and vast.
```

## Technical Notes for Image Generation

### Consistency Guidelines
1. **Perspective**: All images should use a wide shot to capture the full room
2. **Resolution**: Aim for at least 1024x768 or 1920x1080 for high quality
3. **Aspect Ratio**: 4:3 or 16:9 landscape orientation
4. **No UI Elements**: Pure background images with no text, health bars, or interface elements
5. **No People**: Never include human figures in the scenes
6. **Lighting**: Predominantly dark with single light sources (candles, dim bulbs, moonlight)

### Color Palette Consistency

**Normal Versions**:
- Primary: Deep blacks (#000000 - #1a1a1a)
- Secondary: Dark browns (#2d1f1a - #4a3f35)
- Accent: Dusty greys (#3d3d3d - #5a5a5a)
- Highlight: Sickly yellows (#8b8b4f - #a6a672) for light sources

**Low-Sanity Versions**:
- Primary: Deep purples (#1a0a2e - #2d1b3d)
- Secondary: Sickly greens (#1a3d2e - #2d5a4a)
- Accent: Crimson/rust reds (#4a1a1a - #6d2020)
- Highlight: Eldritch blues (#1a2d4a - #2d4a6d)

### Atmospheric Elements
- **Rain effects** (where appropriate): streaking, mist, wetness
- **Dust particles** in enclosed spaces
- **Shadow depth**  to create unease
- **Subtle asymmetry** to create discomfort
- **Water damage** on walls and surfaces
- **Weathering and decay** throughout

## Generation Order (Priority)

When quota is available, generate in this order for best gameplay flow:

1. **living_room.png** + distorted (contains car keys—player visits early)
2. **study.png** + distorted (critical story location)
3. **grandmothers_room.png** + distorted (critical story location)  
4. **utility_room.png** + distorted (power restoration—gameplay critical)
5. **storage_closet.png** + distorted (salt pouch location)
6. **outside_porch.png** + distorted (late-game escape location)
7. **hidden_shrine.png** + distorted (final ritual location)

## Post-Generation Tasks

After each image is generated:
1. Save to `public/images/scenes/[filename].png`
2. Update the corresponding JSON file's `backgroundImage` path
3. Review object placements and adjust `rect` coordinates if needed
4. Update the coordinate reference guide with actual placements
5. Test in-game to verify clickable regions align with visuals
